/** \brief A class to reliably carry out floating point comparisons, storing
 * marginal cases for future reference.
 *
 * Floating point comparisons can be unreliable on some processor
 * architectures, and can produce unpredictable results. On a number of popular
 * Intel processors, floating point numbers are held to higher precision when
 * in registers than when in memory. When a register is swapped from a register
 * to memory, a truncation error, and in some situations this can create
 * circumstances where for two numbers c and d, the program finds c>d first,
 * but later c<d. The programmer has no control over when the swaps between
 * memory and registers occur, and recompiling with slightly different code can
 * give different results. One solution to avoid this is to force the compiler
 * to evaluate everything in memory (e.g. by using the -ffloat-store option in
 * the GNU C++ compiler) but this could be viewed overkill, since it slows the
 * code down, and the extra register precision is useful.
 *
 * In the plane cutting routine of the voronoicell class, we need to reliably
 * know whether a vertex lies inside, outside, or on the cutting plane, since
 * if it changed during the tracing process there would be confusion. This
 * class makes these tests reliable, by storing the results of marginal cases,
 * where the vertex lies within tolerance2 of the cutting plane. If that vertex
 * is tested again, then code looks up the value of the table in a buffer,
 * rather than doing the floating point comparison again. Only vertices which
 * are close to the plane are stored and tested, so this routine should create
 * minimal computational overhead.

 *
 * This class encapsulates all the routines for storing and calculating a
 * single Voronoi cell. The cell can first be initialized by the init() function
 * to be a rectangular box. The box can then be successively cut by planes
 * using the plane function. Other routines exist for outputting the cell,
 * computing its volume, or finding the largest distance of a vertex from the
 * cell center.  The cell is described by two arrays. pts[] is a floating point
 * array which holds the vertex positions. ed[] holds the table of edges, and
 * also a relation table that determines how two vertices are connected to one
 * another. The relation table is redundant, but helps speed up the
 * computation. The function check_relations() checks that the relational table
 * is valid. */
